## Why Git?

In response to our takedown, we've embraced Git as our new home:
- **Decentralized** - No single point of failure
- **Continuous Evolution** - Always improving

## Liquid Glass

Experience the web through our signature Liquid Glass aesthetic:
- **Frosted surfaces** - Soft, blurred elements that create depth
- **Fluid transitions** - Smooth animations that feel natural
- **Light refraction effects** - Dynamic highlights that respond to interaction
- **Depth layering** - Visual hierarchy through transparent overlays

This modern design approach ensures Wix's Space not only works flawlessly but looks stunning doing it.
